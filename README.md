### How to Play
To play this game, simply copy the index.html and script.js files in the redo folder and create your own directory with these files saved. You can forego having the index.html if you would like to play this game in your terminal, by running the node script.js command. Otherwise, this can be played in your browser by running the live-server . command in your terminal and opening your console through the developer tools. If played on a browser, simply refresh to reload a new instance of the game.

### The Rules
A deck of 52 cards is split between two players, who will then flip over the first card of the decks and compare the values. The player with the higher value takes both cards and they repeat until a player no longer has any cards, in which they lose the game. If cards of equal value are played, the players go to war! 3 more cards are taken out of each player's deck, with a fourth one being flipped. The winner takes all the cards played during that round. If the cards are of matching value again they go to war until a winner can be determined. If a player has to go to war but does not have enough cards to do so, they lose!
